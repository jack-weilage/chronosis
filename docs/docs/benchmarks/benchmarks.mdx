`Chronosis` is fast. But how fast?

:::note
`date-fns` is (likely) impossible to beat for some functions. This is mostly due to its modular archetecture, which eliminates the overhead associated with classes. `date-fns` is included in this benchmark suite to show the absolute fastest alternative.

:::note
Some benchmarks are extremely close (e.g. `toString` and `valueOf`) and shouldn't be considered statistically important.
